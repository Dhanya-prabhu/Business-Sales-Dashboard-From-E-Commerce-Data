📝 Overview:

In this project, I built a Professional, Interactive Sales Dashboard using Power BI and Excel based on real-world e-commerce sales data. 
The goal of the dashboard is to help business stakeholders and decision-makers understand:

📦 What are the best-selling products?

📈 When do sales peak throughout the year?

🗂 Which categories or regions bring in the most revenue?


This task helped me develop core data analytics skills by transforming raw data into actionable insights through visual storytelling.
